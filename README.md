# Helsinki Network Analysis

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the **Network Analysis** course at the **University of Helsinki**.  

The course focuses on:

- Graph theory and network representations  
- Network metrics: degree, density, clustering, centrality  
- Weighted and unweighted networks  
- Visualization of complex networks using Python (NetworkX, Matplotlib)  

## Project Highlights

1. **Course Network Visualization**  
   - Loading and analyzing a course network (`course_network_l2.adjlist`)  
   - Node sizes reflect degrees  
   - Edge thickness reflects number of shared topics  
   - Top-5 most connected courses labeled

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10  
- networkx  
- matplotlib
